When many people are working on same project or there is a possiblity of changing computers by the user.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Extra files added at GitHub might not be needed and may cause hindrance in the flow of program creation.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks - clones one github repository into ours repository online.
clones - clones a repository online or local to a local directory
branches - creates a banches along with masteer branch in which changes can be made locally.
forks can be used when we want to modify an open source project through our own repository
clones are used when we want to make changes locally
branches are used when many people are working on a project and experimental changes are to be made.
