What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git folder is added. It is needed to track the history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area contains files to be committed to the repository after some changes have been made to working directory. It helps in committing certain files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
We can check how many files are staged and can make more than one commits if there are different number of files.
